      <h3>‚ú® First Reading: All Paths Meet in Silence</h3>
      <p>Beyond traditions and names, there is one truth. The Masters across time have pointed to this same stillness ‚Äî the silence from which all arises. When you turn inward and rest as awareness itself, the division between seeker and sought dissolves. In that recognition, you come full circle, finding that what you sought was never apart from you.</p>

      <h3>üåø Second Reading: The Gentle Witness</h3>
      <p>When the mind races and the heart feels heavy, pause. Notice that you are the one aware of the thoughts and sensations, not the thoughts themselves. This gentle witnessing is not cold or distant ‚Äî it is tender presence. In recognizing yourself as the witness, the turbulence softens, and clarity dawns naturally. The Masters called this resting as the Self, the Christ within, the Buddha nature. It is ever-present, waiting only to be noticed.</p>
